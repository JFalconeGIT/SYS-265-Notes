# dhcp_check.ps1
# This script retrieves and displays the current domain user's name along with key network configuration details
# from the primary IPv4-enabled network adapter, including IP address, DHCP server, default gateway, and DNS servers.
# It uses WMI to access network adapter configuration for compatibility and completeness.
# Note: This assumes a Windows environment with PowerShell. Run with administrative privileges if needed for full access.

# Retrieve the current logged-in domain user
$currentUser = [System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent().Name
